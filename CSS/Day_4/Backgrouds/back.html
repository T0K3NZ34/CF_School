<!-- Summary:

there are ways to style the background of the website, if you want to grade the color of the background or use a picture you need to use the "background-image" PROPERTY PROPERTY PROPERTY.

 if you want to grade the colour then you need to chose the "linear-gradient" optionn and write the colours separated by units and a comma to signalize where the colour end and when the next colour starts, there is also the option of repeat the gradient by using "repeatig-linear-gradient" that makes it possible to create different designs with the gradients of colours

To insert an image after the "background-image" you have to insert an url and you either link a piture from the web, or you use 
 url ("/wherever you have the picture"), to insert different img you just put a comma after the url and insert another url with another picture. you can also add properties to all of the images py separating each property by a comma exampple:

background-position: (first img) center top, (second img) center bottom


the first img hs priority and if  you put  htekm both on te top of ech other the img nr1 will stay on top while teh second wil stay behind it-->
