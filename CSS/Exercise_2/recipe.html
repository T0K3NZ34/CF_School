            <li>1 Pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>

            <ol>
                <li>
                  "Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a sheet
                  pan with parchment paper. Draw a 9 inch circle on the parchment.
                  An easy way to do this is to draw around the outside of a 9 inch
                  pan with a pencil."
                </li>
                <li>
                  "In a large bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks
                  form. Add 3/4 cup of the sugar gradually, while continuing to
                  whip. Make sure sugar is completely dissolved. Mix together the
                  remaining 1/4 cup sugar with the cornstarch; lightly fold into
                  meringue with lemon juice."
                </li>
                <li>
                  "Spread a layer of meringue to fit a circle on parchment,
                  approximately 1/4 inch thick. With the remainder of mixture, a
                  pipe or spoon swirls around the edges to form a shallow bowl
                  shape."
                </li>
                <li>
                  "In a large bowl, combine the cream and half a cup of
                  confectioners sugar, and whip until thickened. Decorate with fruit
                  of your choice; strawberries are excellent."
