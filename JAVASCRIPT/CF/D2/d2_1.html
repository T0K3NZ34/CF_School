      // FUNCTIONS
      // A function is a reusable block that you can define as many times as needed, it can take inputs, perform specoific tasks and sometimes give back a result.
      //for exampple if you need to do the same equation many times in your code but with different numbers you can do this:
      function addnumers(x, y) {
        console.log(x + y);
      }

      //ARROW FUNCTION
      //arrow functions remove the need of writing function to create a function, imnstead we use this:
      // const x(x is for te name of our function)= () => {}   

      const suma = (x,y) => {
        return x + y;
      }

      //Variable SCOPES LOCAL AND GLOBAL

      //A global scope is a variable that its created outside of a funtion and can be calle at any time
      //A local scope is a variable that is declared inside od a function
