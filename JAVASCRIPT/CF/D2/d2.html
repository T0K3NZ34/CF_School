        //ARRAYS
        // an arra is a variable that can sture a list ofdifferent values, each of the items inside the array is called an element, which each of them have a specific position on an index that starts with the number 0 to initiate an array you have to use [] and separate the items with ,

        let vegetables=['carrot', 'cucumber', 'tomato' ];
        console.log(vegetables[0]); //this is how you access an element
        console.log(vegetables);
        

        vegetables[0]= 'avocado'; //you can also change the value on an item like this 
        console.log(vegetables[0]);
        console.log(vegetables);


        //We can change the elements of a CONSTANT Array but cant change the Array itself

        const fruits= ['apple', 'banana', 'pear'];
        fruits[0]= 'paprika';
        // fruits = ['meat']; //this will display an error

        

        //ARRAY METHODS
        //How we can interact differently with arrays

        let numbers = [1, 2];
        numbers.push('banana', 20); //the push method appends one or more elements at thet end of the array
        console.log(numbers);
        //this is called a destructive method since it changes directly the original array
        numbers.unshift('what', 40);
        console.log(numbers);
        //like the push method, but this one adds stuff at the beginning of the array
        

        let onumbers = [1,3,4];
        let lastnumber=onumbers.pop();
        console.log(lastnumber);
        console.log(onumbers);
        //the pop metho takes the last element of an array and returns it, think about a plate of fruits, when you use the 
        //pop method is like you are holding the number in your hand amd you oonly show the ones you still have on the plate
        let lastshift=onumbers.shift();
        console.log(lastshift);
        console.log(onumbers);
        //like the pop method this also takes an element but from the beginning


        //POP and SHIFT DOESNT TAKE ABY ARGUMENTS CAUSE THEY REMOVE SOMETHING!!!!



        let games=['zalo', 'MR', 'SmashB']
        console.log(games.sort());
        //the sort method if not given other instructions it will sort the elements in alphabetical order

        
        let names=['john','jkaka','slsls'];
        console.log(names.slice(0,2));
        //the slice method creates a new array using the startingand the ending value you write in the slice ()
        
        
        let cities=['vienna','paris','moscau'];
        // using SPLICE will add or remove elements formo the original array and it wont create a new one like slice does
        cities.splice(1,0,'rome');
        // Argument meaning: where to start, how many spaces will it delete and occupy, what will come instead of the deleted elements
        console.log(cities);
        
        //The join method is for displaying the array by filling the spaces in between the elements
        let saludos=['hola', 'que tal', 'como estas'];
        console.log(saludos.join(' y '));
