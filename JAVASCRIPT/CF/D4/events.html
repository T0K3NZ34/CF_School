      //In order to create an event there are a couple of things i have to take into consideration

      //in this case i have to give the button an id to recall it in my java code later on
      //then you select the id in js, create a function that does something and then the event happens
      // .addEventListener is a great way to react to the triggering of an event
      // .addEventListener('the action', what function is going to run when it happens, just set it to false )
