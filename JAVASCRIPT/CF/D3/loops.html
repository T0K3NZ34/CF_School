        //SetDate Sets the day on the month from 1 to 31
        //setMonth sets the moth from 0 being january to 11 being december
        //setFullFear() sets teh full year date e.g 2025
        //setMinutes() sets the minutes from 0 to 59
        //SetSeconds() sets the seconds form 0 to 59
        //toDateString() converts the date object into a readable date string e.g "Wed Dec 5"
