        //OBJECTS

        //in java script most things are objects of some kind , exept primitives (sting, number, boolean, null and undefined) are objects
        //person example: imagine the person is an object, it has its attributes like a name a last name and the method is what he does in this case a person can speak

        let person = { //Object
            firstname:'Jorge', //Properties
            lastname:'De la Torre', //Properties
            age:25,//Attriburtes
            drivingLicence: true, //Properties
            hobbies:['Ball', 'Music', 'Read'], //Properties
            greeting: function(){ //Method
                console.log(`hello my name is Jorge`);
                
            }
        };

        //this is how you create an object with many properties:
        // let nameofthevariable ={
            //here goes all of its properties no ''='' needed 
            //instead you do this: propertyone:21,
            //you use the "," to separate poperties      
        //}; you close your object with a ";"
        console.log(person);

        //ACCSESSING PROPERTIES
        //to be able to accsess them we just need to put a ".'the poperties name'"

        console.log(person.firstname);
        //when you access an array you can also look for an specific index like this
        console.log(person.hobbies[2]);
        
        //ACCSESSING METHODS
        //for this you dont need to console log the greeting you just do it like this
        person.greeting();
        
        // MODIFYING PROPERTIES
        //in orther to modify a property we can just do it as always
        person.age=31;
        console.log(person.age);
        
        //ADDING PROPERTIES
        //wecan also add properties like by writing the variable name and the new property 
        person.gender='male';
        console.log(person);
        
        //FOR...IN loop
        //the for in loop loops trough the properties of an object

        let objeto={
            numerop:1,
            numeros:2, 
        };
        for (let prop in objeto ) {
            console.log(prop + objeto[prop]);
            //use the objeto[] to look into the value of the properrties aswqell
        }
