    console.log(fullname.toLowerCase());
    
    //you can look for the position of the first occurrence of a certain character on you string aswell

    console.log(fullname.indexOf('T'));//it is lower and uppercase sensitive, this means if you have a lowercase t it will display -1 as well
    console.log(fullname.indexOf('K'));//if the character doesnt exist in the string then it wioll display -1

    //you can also check for the character on an idex number
    console.log(fullname.charAt(3));
    

    //SUBSTRING
    //you can get the console to display only a part of the string by using .substring(start point, end point)

    console.log(fullname.substring(2, 17));//the indexof a string starts with 0!!
    
    //SPLIT
    //you can split your strings in to substrings by using 
    // .split(after which character split)
    console.log(fullname.split(" "));
    
    
    //we can chain different operators like this
    console.log(fullname.split(" ").reverse().join());
    //this reverses the string and also makes a new string with commas in between where we split stuff
