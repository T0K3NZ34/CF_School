    <p>
        Who's somebody you know you shouldn't call?
        Who were you kissing in the back of your car?
        Who's the one, the one who got away?
        Who are you thinking of when you end the day?
        'Cause I know you can see
        We're more than a secret
        You know I can be
        Just what you want
    </p>

        <h4>Chorus</h4>
    </span>
    <p>
        'Cause I've been out until the morning
        And I don't think I'll last another night
        I knew the feeling would be forming
        After I took a look into your eyes
        But are you ready for it, darling?
        I'll take all your responsibilities
        And you've got everybody calling
        But I know that you're calling after me
    </p>

    <p>
        Don't play dumb, I know you fantasize
        You could have me on my back every night
        I don't mind the things that you've been doing
        Think you need someone like me to get through it
        And I know you can see
        We'll let people talk
        And you know we can be
        Just what they want
    </p>

        But are you ready for it, darling?
